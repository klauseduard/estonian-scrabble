> **Important Note**: This documentation is AI-generated. The entire project, including all documentation files, README guides, and development notes, was created through AI-assisted programming using Cursor IDE's agent mode with Claude-3.5-Sonnet model. The development process was conducted as an experiment in "YOLO mode" where the AI agent was responsible for code generation, documentation writing, and debugging assistance.

A Python-based implementation of the classic Scrabble board game, specifically designed for the Estonian language. Features include Estonian alphabet support (Ãµ, Ã¤, Ã¶, Ã¼, Å¡, Å¾), Estonian wordlist validation, and a modern graphical user interface.

     cd estonian-scrabble
     ```

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Windows: Press Win+R, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - macOS: Press Cmd+Space, type `terminal`, press Enter
   - Linux: Press Ctrl+Alt+T

3. **Navigate to Game Directory**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/scrabble  # Replace with actual path
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Game**
   ```bash
   python main.py  # or python3 main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**
   - Run the game using the command above
   - The game window will open with an empty board
   - Two players take turns

2. **Game Controls**
   - **Mouse Controls:**
     - Left-click and hold to drag tiles from your rack to the board
     - Release left mouse button to place a tile
     - Right-click a tile on the board to return it to your rack
     - Left-click buttons ("Commit", "Pass", "Exchange") to perform actions
   - Click "Commit" to end your turn when you're satisfied with your word placement
   - Click "Pass" to skip your turn
   - Click "Exchange" to swap tiles (counts as your turn)

3. **First Move**
   - Must place tiles through the center square
   - Must form a valid Estonian word
   - Word must read left-to-right or top-to-bottom

4. **Subsequent Moves**
   - New tiles must connect to existing words
   - All formed words must be valid Estonian words
   - Words read left-to-right or top-to-bottom

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Python not found" or similar error**
   - Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`
   - Restart your terminal/command prompt

2. **"pip not found" error**
   - Make sure pip is installed
   - Try using `pip3` instead of `pip`
   - On Windows, try: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Game doesn't start**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed
   - Try reinstalling dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Estonian characters don't display correctly**
   - Make sure your system supports UTF-8
   - Try updating your terminal/command prompt font

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Look for similar issues in the project's issue tracker
3. Create a new issue with:
   - Your operating system
   - Python version (`python --version`)
   - Error message (if any)
   - Steps to reproduce the problem

## Game Rules

- The game follows standard Scrabble rules with adaptations for Estonian alphabet
- Supports Estonian special characters (Ãµ, Ã¤, Ã¶, Ã¼, Å¡, Å¾)
- Uses Estonian wordlist for word validation
- Premium squares follow standard Scrabble board layout

## Development

### Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Game Logic (`game/`):**
   - `state.py`: Manages game state, player turns, and tile placement
   - `word_validator.py`: Handles word validation and scoring
   - `constants.py`: Contains game constants and configuration

2. **User Interface (`ui/`):**
   - `components.py`: Reusable UI components
   - Handles user input and visual feedback

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. Determine which module should contain the new code
2. Update relevant tests (when we add them)
3. Follow the existing code style
4. Update documentation

### Code Style

- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Write docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
