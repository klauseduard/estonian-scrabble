# Development Process

This project was developed as an experiment in AI-assisted programming, utilizing Cursor IDE's agent mode powered by the Claude-3.5-Sonnet model. The development was conducted in "YOLO mode", where the AI agent was given significant autonomy in the development process.

> **Development Timeline**: The core game implementation was completed in just 30 minutes of AI-assisted development. The entire project, including polishing, bug fixes, and comprehensive documentation with screenshots (where the AI guided the screenshot creation process), took only a couple of hours. This demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of AI-assisted development when using modern tools like Cursor's agent mode.

## AI-Assisted Development

### Tools Used
- **Cursor IDE**: Primary development environment
- **Claude-3.5-Sonnet**: AI model powering the agent
- **Agent Mode**: Cursor's feature for AI-assisted development

### Development Approach
The development was conducted through a conversational interface where:
1. The human developer provided high-level requirements and feedback
2. The AI agent:
   - Suggested implementation approaches
   - Wrote and modified code
   - Fixed bugs
   - Created documentation
   - Managed git operations
   - Provided explanations and recommendations

### Key Features Implemented with AI
- Estonian character support and word validation
- Game board implementation with premium squares
- Tile placement and validation logic
- User interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time word validation
- Documentation with screenshots

## Lessons Learned

### Advantages
1. **Rapid Development**: The AI agent could quickly implement complex features
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The agent maintained detailed documentation throughout
3. **Bug Detection**: The agent could identify and fix issues proactively
4. **Code Quality**: The agent followed best practices and maintained consistent style

### Challenges
1. **Context Management**: The agent needed occasional reminders about existing code
2. **Complex Operations**: Some operations (like git commands with &&) needed step-by-step approach
3. **Edge Cases**: Some game-specific rules needed explicit clarification

## Future Considerations

For future AI-assisted development:
1. Maintain clear communication about project requirements
2. Break down complex operations into smaller steps
3. Regularly verify and test implemented features
4. Keep the AI informed about the current state and context
5. Document the development process itself for future reference

## Contributing

When contributing to this project, be aware that it was developed with AI assistance. The codebase reflects this unique development approach, and contributions should maintain the established patterns and documentation standards.
